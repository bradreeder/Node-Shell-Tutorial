Introduction

It's important to realise that, in giving you access to the file system and network,
node can be used for more than just creating web servers.

In this series of lessons we are going to use some of node's features to do some
shell scripting!

A shell script is a program designed to be run by the Unix shell. Typical operations
performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

You've likely come across some typical shell commands already. Have you used cat,
ls, or grep in your terminal before? To start off today, we're going to implement
our own versions of these commands using javascript.
