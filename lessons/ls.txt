Exercise 2 - ls

ls is a command that when called will output the names of all the files and
directories in the directory it was called from to the terminal. It is called
like this:

ls

Try using ls in one of the folders of this repo to see what it looks like.

Task

Inside ls.js write a program that when called like this from the terminal
node path_to_ls.js will output the names of all the files and directories in the
directory you called from to the terminal.

Calling node ls.js from the lesson-1 folder of this repo should print:

cat.js grep.js ls.js public

Calling node ../ls.js from the public folder should print:

grep.scm index.html solutions.js, etc.

Don't worry about being exact with the spacing, just print them on the same line
with some spacing.

Hint: you're going to need the method process.cwd() to access the directory your
node command was called from. (You can't say I'm cryptic!).
