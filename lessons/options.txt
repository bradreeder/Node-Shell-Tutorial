Exercise 3 - options

Many unix commands have what are called options. Options are arguments you can
pass to the execution of the command that modify its behaviour. They are typically
in the format of a dash followed by a lowercase letter.

ls -a for example will show all the directories/files starting with a dot
(like .gitignore) that will otherwise be hidden when you call the ls command.

Task

Your task is to modify your existing ls command in ls.js so that it can accept an
option argument.

Specifically: node path_to_ls.js -ex extension. If -ex is passed as first argument,
your ls command should only print the names of the files in the current directory
that have the extension specified by the second argument. Your program should do
its normal behaviour if no arguments are provided.

node ls.js -ex js when called from the root directory should print:

cat.js grep.js ls.js

and node ../ls.js -ex scm from public:

grep.scm, etc.
