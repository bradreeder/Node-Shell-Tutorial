Exercise 1 - cat

In unix, cat is a command that takes the path to a file as its argument and will
output the contents of that file to the terminal. It is used like this:

cat path_to_file.extension

Try outputting the contents of index.html in the public folder of this repo to
the terminal to see what it looks like.

Task

Inside cat.js write a program that when called like this from the terminal

node path_to_cat.js path_to_file.extension

will output the contents of that latter file to the terminal like cat.

Hint: You will need the process object and the fs module.
