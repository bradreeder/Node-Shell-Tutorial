Exercise 4 - grep

grep stands for 'global regular expression print.' It's essentially a Unix
regular expression command that will print to the terminal all lines in a file
that match a specified pattern.

In our public directory calling grep 'all' grep.scm from the command-line will print:

;;;   And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
;;;      Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
;;;Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
;;;   Among the river sallows, borne aloft
;;;      And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

Where all is the pattern it is looking for and grep.scm the specified file to
search for it in. Note that it prints the whole line if it finds the pattern inside it.

Task

Inside grep.js write a program that when executed like this

node path_to_grep.js pattern file

will print every line in the file specified that matches the pattern specified.
Each line should be printed on its own line.

Hint: try doing this just with fs first and see what happens. You're going to
need a specific core module in order to access the whole line of a file as you're
reading it.

Look through the list of core modules or use Stack Overflow if you get stuck.
Please don't use third party modules for this exercise. You should default to
using core modules while you're learning where it's possible to.
